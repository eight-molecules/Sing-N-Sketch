SketchingView Class
Author: Dakota C. B.

The SketchingView class is a UIView that holds all of the information for drawing capabilities.

Variables
brush: an instance of the brush class. This variable affects the color of the path that the user draws
palette: an instance of the palette class. This variable holds the colors for a palette
audio: an instance of the audio class. This variable is used for detecting user audio to manipulate the brushâ€™s color
multiplier: a float used as a way to show amplitude in the drawing
undoArray: array that holds previous state of the canvas
redoArray: array that undos what the undo array has done to the view
drawView: An UIImageView that holds the path that the user draws without lifting their figure
canvasView: An UIImageView that is the amalgamation of all of the previous draw views
points: a tuple holding points that determine the line creation when the user draws

Functions
override init() sets the background color to white

required init() creates a palette based on the values in the function

touchesBegan() saves locations of where the user touched on the screen

touchesMoved() sets all of the information for the line to be made, creates a mid point based on where the user touches and the previous touch, and then creates that line on drawView

touchesCanelled() if the touch is not able to be made, ends the touch context

touchesEnded() takes the image drawn by the drawView and puts it into the canvasView

drawRect() updates the audio variable with the audio created by the user to influence colors used to draw and size of the line

newDrawing() clears everything and creates a new drawing

updatePalette() creates a new palette based on the values in required init

undo() removes the current state of the screen with the first previous one

redo() replace the current state with one already created
